## **Problem Statement**

Gamers often play across multiple sessions, modes, and with different friends, but they rarely get a consolidated, engaging summary of their performance, achievements, and experiences. While raw game statistics are available, they lack **personalized storytelling** that highlights progress, memorable milestones, and social connections. This makes it harder for players to reflect on their growth, celebrate achievements, and stay motivated.

## **Proposed Solution**

Develop a **Gaming Flashback Feature** that automatically aggregates and visualizes gameplay data into an engaging, narrative-driven recap. The system will:

1. Analyze performance metrics such as scores, win/loss ratios, and skill progression.
2. Track and display the friends played with most frequently.
3. Summarize time spent across different game modes.
4. Highlight milestones and achievements with timestamps.

The flashback will be presented as a **story-like interactive experience** (cards, slides, or short video format) to make insights fun, memorable, and shareable.

## **Use Cases**

1. **Individual Player Insight**

   * A player views their yearly (or monthly) flashback to track improvement and milestones.
   * Example: “You improved your win rate by 15% this year.”

2. **Social Engagement**

   * Players see who they played with most and celebrate shared achievements.
   * Example: “You and Alex teamed up 42 times—your strongest duo!”

3. **Motivation & Retention**

   * Gamers are motivated to keep improving by seeing progress over time.
   * Example: Your accuracy improved by 10% since last season. Next milestone - “Sharp shooter”

4. **Community & Sharing**

   * Players share flashback highlights on social media, creating organic promotion.
